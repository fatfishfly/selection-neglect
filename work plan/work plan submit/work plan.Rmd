This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
 library('ganttrify')
ganttrify(project = ganttrify::test_project,
          project_start_date = "2021-03",
          )
```
```{r}
library(xlsx)
plan<-read.xlsx(file="/Users/feiyu/Desktop/work plan.xlsx",1) 
```
```{r}
library(ganttrify)
ganttrify(project=plan, hide_wp = TRUE,size_text_relative = 0.8,mark_quarters = TRUE,project_start_date="2022-11")
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
